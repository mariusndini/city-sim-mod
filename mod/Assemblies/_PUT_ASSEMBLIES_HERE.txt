This directory must contain the following files:

- Assembly-CSharp.dll
- ColossalManaged.dll
- ICities.dll
- UnityEngine.dll
- UnityEngine.UI.dll

These files can be found in the following location:

    <Steam>\SteamApps\common\Cities_Skylines\Cities_Data\Managed

Copy those files into this directory.

(I personally prefer to create symbolic links, but copying them is the easier solution.)
